The proposal introduces a blockchain-based decentralized national e-voting system to enhance election integrity, security, and efficiency. By using blockchain, votes are securely stored in a tamper-proof ledger, making it nearly impossible to alter election results. Voter eligibility is verified in real-time through Aadhar card IDs, while biometric verification (via a webcam or front camera) ensures the right person votes. Cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs, protect voter privacy, ensuring votes remain anonymous yet verifiable. An admin panel allows for election scheduling, candidate management, and result declaration, while the system's decentralized nature reduces the cost of hosting elections by eliminating traditional infrastructure. The proposal also evaluates popular blockchain frameworks and includes a case study to demonstrate the system's viability, aiming to provide an authenticated, end-to-end verifiable, and secure solution to improve election processes.
